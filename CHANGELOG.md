## 3.4.1 (2019-05-03)

### Fixes

- Updated [adbkit-apkreader](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit-apkreader) to fix an APK manifest parsing issue on applications processed by 360 encryption services, which changes the `application` key to `com.stub.StubApp`. Thanks @JChord!
- Updated [adbkit](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit) to public key parsing on recent versions of ADB. Thanks @codeskyblue!

### Enhancements

- Exposed the [`ZMQ_IPV6`](http://api.zeromq.org/3-3:zmq-ctx-set#toc5) environment variable, making it possible to enable IPv6 for ZeroMQ. Thanks @aokhotin!

## 3.4.0 (2018-08-09)

### Enhancements

- Android 9.0 is now supported. This feature was sponsored by [HeadSpin](https://headspin.io/).
- The OAuth2 unit now supports state tokens. Thanks @quangola!
- [STFService.apk](https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk) can now display the identity activity (red screen) automatically if a device gets disconnected from USB (or ADB), which can make maintenance easier. This feature is in beta, please enable it by running `adb shell pm grant jp.co.cyberagent.stf android.permission.DUMP` on the devices you want to try it on. Thanks @Malinskiy!

### Fixes

- Use `ps -lef` instead of `ps` to list pids on Android 8.x. In new versions, `ps` doesn't return anything. Thanks @thinkhy!

## 3.3.1 (2018-07-14)

### Fixes

- Fixed ADB's new device states (`connecting`, `authorizing`) not being recognized by STF. Thanks @obrie!
- Updated [STFService.apk](https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk) to fix an issue on high aspect ratio devices like the Mi Mix 2 where a portion of the screen may not have been visible.
- Updated [adbkit-apkreader](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit-apkreader) to resolve issues with certain APK files that were unparseable and therefore could not be installed. The issue was with long strings in the manifest file.
- Updated [minitouch](https://github.com/openstf/minitouch) to fix touch detection issues on Meizu Pro7 Plus.

## 3.3.0 (2018-03-25)

### Enhancements

- Added a new column to the device list that displays the OpenGL ES version of each device. Note that you may have to reset the columns once if you can't see it. Thanks @koral--!
- Added a new `--no-screen-reset` option to disable the default behavior of resetting rotation and returning to the home screen after a user stops using a device. Thanks @0rzech!
- Added a new `--saml-id-provider-callback-url` option to the auth-saml2 unit. Thanks @0rzech!

### Fixes

- Fixed a setup issue with TPS650.
- Fixed an issue where most uploads would fail due to a breaking configuration change in a dependency.
- Updated [minitouch](https://github.com/openstf/minitouch) to fix multitouch issues on some devices that require the `BTN_TOUCH` kernel event. Lifting a contact while having and keeping one held down may have prevented any events from being processed until a new touchdown event.

## 3.2.0 (2017-12-06)

### Enhancements

- Android 8.1 is now supported.
- The network column in the device list is now based on a value that gets updated in real time. The format of the column has changed slightly due to this change.
- The `--mute-master` option now accepts the values `never` (default), `inuse` (only when a device is being used), and `always` (mute pre-emptively during setup phase). For backwards compatibility, `--mute-master` with no value maps to `inuse`, and `--no-mute-master` to `never`.
- The battery level and battery temperature columns are now filterable with comparison operators.
- Log output now includes a timestamp.

## 3.1.0 (2017-08-31)

### Enhancements

- Android 8.0 is now supported. Please note that Android O developer previews are no longer officially supported, though they may or may not still work.

## 3.0.1 (2017-08-21)

### Fixes

- Updated [adbkit](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit) to fix `RangeError: Index out of range` errors when parsing newer APKs that use UTF-8 encoding for their string pools.

## 3.0.0 (2017-08-09)

### Enhancements

- Added support for Android O Developer Preview 1 (note that any later previews are not supported yet)
- You can now set screen JPEG quality with the `SCREEN_JPEG_QUALITY` environment variable at launch time. Can be useful for slow networks.
- Switched to [yargs](http://yargs.js.org) for option parsing to make it easier to modify the CLI.
- Almost all command line options can now be specified with environment variables.
- Internal commands are now hidden from help output but can still be used.
- Running the `stf` binary without a command now errors and shows help output (previously there was no output whatsoever).
- Improved help messages for various options.
- Added an app switch key. Thanks @koral--!

### Fixes

- Fixed Lenovo A806 and most likely other cheap Lenovo devices as well by updating [adbkit](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit).
- Fixed ZUK Z1, Z2 and others by adding an alternate install location for our binaries, since `/data/local/tmp` is mounted as noexec on those devices. Thanks @dkw72n!
- Updated [adbkit-apkreader](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit-apkreader) to resolve issues with certain APK files that were unparseable and therefore failed installation. We've only seen a single a single APK with this issue, but there could be more.
- Updated [adbkit-apkreader](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit-apkreader) to resolve another unrelated parsing issue with slightly malformed manifest files.
- Updated [adbkit](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit) to resolve an issue where trailing spaces in an adb public key would cause an error during adb connect.
- Updated [adbkit](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit) to resolve issues with log parsing on Android 7.0 and later, caused by Android no longer transforming `\n` to `\r\n`.
- Updated [adbkit](https://github.com/openstf/adbkit) to resolve an issue with recent versions of ADB that include a null byte in `adbkey.pub`, which was causing validation to fail.
- Fixed [minitouch](https://github.com/openstf/minitouch) on Blackberry PRIV.

### Misc

- We now use [please-update-dependencies](https://github.com/sorccu/please-update-dependencies) to check for outdated dependencies when running from source. It's a super quick local check that compares `package.json` with installed dependencies. Should help avoid unnecessary issues caused by forgetting to run `npm install` after `git pull`.

### Breaking changes

- Node v6.9.x or later is now required. Earlier versions will not work. To avoid a sudden flood of issues about this change, [please-update-dependencies](https://github.com/sorccu/please-update-dependencies) enforces the minimum version and tells you if you need to update.
- The `-C` shortcut for the `--no-cleanup` option has been removed due to the switch to [yargs](http://yargs.js.org). Please use the full `--no-cleanup` option instead.
- Although likely not used by anyone, it was possible to give multiple ZeroMQ endpoints to options such as `--connect-push` by separating them with commas. This is still possible but now works in a different way due to the switch to [yargs](http://yargs.js.org). Comma-separated hosts in a single value are no longer accepted. If you need to specify multiple hosts, simply use the option as many times as you like. This change is unlikely to have any impact whatsoever on most users.
- The `--devices` option of `stf doctor` has been removed due to unnecessary complexity.

## 2.3.0 (2016-11-09)

Minor release addressing the following:

### Fixes

- Fixed [minicap](https://github.com/openstf/minicap) on various devices running Android 4.2, incl. Qumo Quest 405, Yoga Tablet 8 etc. There may still be some that do not work, as 4.2 was customized pretty heavily by some makers. Thanks to @dkw72n for tracking down the issue and coming up with a fix! And as always, please let us know if you find any device (running any Android version) that does not work.

## 2.2.0 (2016-11-09)

Minor release addressing the following:

### Fixes

- Fixed [minicap](https://github.com/openstf/minicap) on some/all Samsung devices running Android 5.1.1, which did not work previously. Thanks to @dkw72n for tracking down the issue and coming up with a fix!

### Misc

- The [openstf/stf-armv7l](https://hub.docker.com/r/openstf/stf-armv7l/) Docker image is being built again. Our previous armv7l build server died and [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) did not have more available until recently.

## 2.1.0 (2016-10-24)

Minor release addressing the following:

### Enhancements

* Added optional HTTP Basic auth to the mock auth unit, for when you can't set up a proper auth adapter but still want at least a tiny bit of added security.
* Considerably smaller and up to date official [Docker image for armv7l](https://hub.docker.com/r/openstf/stf-armv7l/) with automated nightly builds on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/). May occasionally break for a while but we aim to always keep it fully up to date.
* Added instructions for using [Google OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2) login to the deployment guide, making it possible to sign in using your Google account.
* Added a configurable username field to the LDAP auth unit. Thanks [@bananayong](https://github.com/bananayong)!
* Updated and added various translations.

### Fixes

* Fixed screen area not being visible in latest versions of Chrome.
* Fixed Meizu Note 2 and similar devices which did not work due to non-standard output.
* Fixed ports getting leaked causing the provider unit to completely run out of ports if devices die a lot. Thanks [@skyline-gleb](https://github.com/skyline-gleb)!
